    I'm currently studying Honors Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Utah.
    I'm a junior (keeping a hold of my 4.0!), and my expected graduation is May 2026.

    At the University of Utah, I'm in a couple of clubs, namely Gamecraft and the Software Development Club.
    Both clubs have game/code jams every once in a while, and you can see some of the things I've made on the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>!

    During my time so far at the University of Utah, I've taken quite a few classes, including a few pretty relevant ones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer Architecture</li>
    <li>Computer Systems</li>
    <li>Software Practice I and II</li>
    <li>Computer Graphics</li>
    <li>Computer Security</li>
    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>Number Theory</li>
    <li>Analysis I</li>
    <li>Calculus I, II, and III</li>
    <li>Linear Algebra</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I plan to take more classes relating to computer systems, compilers, and operating systems,
    and next year if all goes well I'll be writing my Honors Computer Science thesis.
