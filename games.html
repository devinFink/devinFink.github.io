  <h2>Clockwork Sword</h2>
  <p>
    Working with teams in the Gamecraft club at the University of Utah, I've made quite a few fun little games at this point.

    If you want to play them, you can find them all on <a href="https://guywithapc.itch.io" target="_blank">my itch.io page</a>.

    If you want to see the source code (for most of them), you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/GuyWithaPC" target="_blank">my github page</a>.

  <h2>Minecraft Modding</h2>
  <p>
    I've contributed to an open source set of Minecraft mods by DarkKronicle, mostly GUI modifications to improve quality of life.

    You can find the main mod I contributed to (KronHUD) on <a href="https://github.com/DarkKronicle/KronHUD" target="_blank">Github</a>.

  <h2>Emulators</h2>
  <p>
    I've completed a Chip-8 emulator, worked on a SuperChip/XO-Chip emulator, and have worked on and off on an NES emulator
    (I might return to it eventually and make that one public, I've only finished the processor emulation so far though).

    As usual, you can find (most of) these on <a href="https://github.com/GuyWithaPC" target="_blank">my github page</a>.

  <h2>This Website!</h2>
  <p>
    This portfolio/personal/blog site has been my continuous project for a bit. You can find the source on my github (since it's github pages for now),
    or you can see what it looks like right before your very eyes.
