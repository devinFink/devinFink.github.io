        <p>
            I'm Devin Fink, a student at the University of Utah studying Computer Science with an Emphasis in Game Development.

        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up surrounded by every console and game you could imagine, instilled with a love of games from my game programmers father.
            I believe in the power of games to enrich lives, develop relationships, and tell stories, and want to use my skills to develop
            the next generation of life-changing experiences. I have experience as both a Gameplay engineer and a QA Engineer, and most recently
            have been fascinated with the world of graphics programming.

            In my free time, I love to spend evenings playing couch co-op games with my wife (anybody else playing Split Fiction recently?), or spending time online with friends.
            I also DM a multi-year campaign of DnD, or you may find me painting miniatures next to my wife as she rebinds books and our puppy sleeps nearby.
