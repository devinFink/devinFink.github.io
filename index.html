    I'm Max Petersen, and this is my personal portfolio website.
    Here you can find some info about me, see some projects I've worked on (including this website)

<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>
    Right now I'm a student at the University of Utah studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

    I've been programming simple stuff for longer than I can remember (my dad decided to try and get me to learn BASIC when I was around 10),
    and more recently I've been really interested in mathematics. In both fields, I tend to admire the lower-level simplicity of things
    (for example, bet you didn't know plain HTML+CSS could look so good, no frameworks up in here).
    This has pushed me in a low level software kind of direction, because I love to see how things work
    (and find how to make them work) without a thousand layers of abstraction.

    When I'm not busy being a huge nerd, I love cooking and baking (my roommates at school are on the "Max Meal Plan"),
    heading home to hang out and pet my dogs (pics below because they're so adorable), and playing video games (I am not beating the huge nerd allegations)
