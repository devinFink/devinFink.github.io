    I'm Devin Fink, and this is my personal portfolio website.

<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>
    Right now I'm a student at the University of Utah studying Computer Science with an Emphasis in Game Development.

    I grew up surrounded by every console and game you could imagine, instilled with a love of games from my game developer father.
    I believe in the power of games to enrich lives, develop relationships, and tell stories, and want to use my skills to develop
    the next generation of life-changing experiences. I have experience as both a Gameplay engineer and a QA Engineer, and most recently
    have been fascinated with the world of graphics programming.

    In my free time, I love to spend evenings playing couch co-op games with my wife, or spending time online with friends.
    I also DM a multi-year campaign of DnD, or you may find me painting miniatures next to my wife as she rebinds books.
